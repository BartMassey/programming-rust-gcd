# GCD: Rust command-line utility demo
Copyright (c) 2018 Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, Bart Massey

This command-line utility is a version of the GCD utility
from the O'Reilly *Programming Rust* book by Blandy and
Orendorff. I have enhanced it with the ability to take the
GCD of an arbitrary number of arguments, and cleaned up the
code a little bit.
